## Your Project
A website that allows users to find college preparatory information 

## Inspiration

In some cases, students may not be able to afford intensive
counseling and have access to resources that can guide them
through middle school and high school. Our goal is to help
less-fortunate students attend a community college or a
four-year university through college preparatory information
and commonly asked questions. I have seen first-hand students
who have given up on going to college because of a lack of guidance.
They ended middle school with the idea that college will not be in their future.
By creating College Cloud, we hope to inspire and guide students to
fulfilling their full potential.

## What it does

College Cloud is an essential tool for students to use. Students who
may not know where to start, when it comes to college, can find all the
resources they need: from links to study tools to sample pathways for each grade,
starting from middle school.

## How I built it

College Cloud is a seamlessly functioning site with a navigation bar always at
the top of the screen for users to maneuver. The pages are filled with links,
photos, and dropdown buttons that make for a captivating and interactive experience.
Moreover, its design remains consistent throughout each page; we chose different
fonts for the website name, page titles, and text bodies that remain constant on
each page in an effort to unify the site in its entirety. Each page contains a
simple floral footer with orange accents that became a key background color on
various pages, once again aimed at unifying the College Cloud website.

## Challenges I ran into

We attempted to use a type of layout we never tried before on our testing page. 
It was challenging to learn new forms of HTML layout and debug the page when he had little idea of how to go abotu

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

## What I learned

Being that Creatica is our first hackathon,
we wanted to push ourselves and create
something memorable! We have a decent
understanding of a few languages, as well as
some experience creating websites, but none
were as complex as College Cloud. Our team
dealt with several hiccups in the road that
required foreign solutions, such as creating a
table to increase text responsiveness.
