## Your Project

A website that allows users to find college preparatory information and commonly asked questions in the college process.

## Inspiration

In some cases, students may not be able to afford intensive counseling
and have access to resources that can guide them through middle school and
high school. I have seen first-hand students who have given up on going
to college because of a lack of guidance. They have explained that college
is too expensive and they donâ€™t have the money to do so. In thinking this
way, they ended middle school with the idea that college will not be in their
future. Our goal is to help less-fortunate students attend a community college
or a four-year university through college preparatory information and commonly
asked questions. We hope to inspire and guide students to fulfilling their
full potential.

## What it does

College Cloud is an essential tool for students to use. Students who
may not know where to start, when it comes to college, can find all the
resources they need: from links to study tools to sample pathways for each grade,
starting from middle school.

## How I built it

College Cloud is a seamlessly functioning site with a navigation bar always at
the top of the screen for users to maneuver. The pages are filled with links,
photos, and dropdown buttons that make for a captivating and interactive experience.
Moreover, its design remains consistent throughout each page; we chose different
fonts for the website name, page titles, and text bodies that remain constant on
each page in an effort to unify the site in its entirety. Each page contains a
simple floral footer with orange accents that became a key background color on
various pages, once again aimed at unifying the College Cloud website.

## Challenges I ran into

We attempted a type of layout we never tried before on our testing page. We wanted our text to
be side by side with photos, but we had no idea how to go about it. After a lot of trial
and error, we were successful.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We're proud of how much we were able to complete in such a short span of time. 
We are semi-experienced coders, but this was the most complex website we've all created. 
We're all proud of the amount of work we put into every page, including all of the content 
we wrote. We're proud of our testing page for its layout, our FAQ page for the dropdown 
menus we experimented with, and 
i sent you guys an invite as a team member, check ur email 
ok what should i say my job was
ingrid, i think idk i tink ur purple but i think we didn't really have specific jobs
You could mention what we worked on and how we sometimes would switch off regions 
to help each other when we were stuck on something. TEAMWORK MAKES A DREAM WORK - yes

yayyyyyyy
## What I learned

Being that Creatica is our first hackathon,
we wanted to push ourselves and create
something memorable! We have a decent
understanding of a few languages, as well as
some experience creating websites, but none
were as complex as College Cloud. Our team
dealt with several hiccups in the road that
required foreign solutions, such as creating a
table to increase text responsiveness.

## What's next for College Cloud

In the future, we hope for College Cloud to include chat sections both for 
users to interact with one other, and for users to communicate with the 
site's creators. This way, students can receive support regarding 
their personal concerns in conjunction with general guidelines.
