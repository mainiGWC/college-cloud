          AP stands for Advanced Placement. Taking these tests, through Collegeboard, can help prove that
          you are capable of handling rigorous coursework and eliminate some undergraduate level courses 
          in unversity. You can take AP courses as soon as your freshman year in high school where your 
          teachers help you prepare for the exams. You may also qualify for a fee waiver for your AP 
          exam depending on your financial need. Collegeboard will reduce the fee by $33 for students 
          that are eligible.
