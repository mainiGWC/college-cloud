            AP stands for Advanced Placement. Taking these tests, through
            Collegeboard, can help prove that you are capable of handling
            rigorous coursework and eliminate some undergraduate level courses
            in unversity. You can take AP courses as soon as your freshman year
            in high school where your teachers help you prepare for the exams.
            You may also qualify for a fee waiver for your AP exam depending on
            your financial need. Collegeboard will reduce the fee by $33 for
            students that are eligible.

          Khan Academy is one of the best study tools avaliable to all stuents
          for free. They have everything you need: from AP practice questions to
          life skills. If there is a particular subject you have a hard time
          with, go through the subject on Khan Academy the summer before you
          take the course, and you will be better prepared. Highly recommended!

        Check to see if your local library has any AP exam preparation materials

        publish preparation books with practice tests and tips as well as
        flashcards. They are very effective for studying and cover all parts of

        Sometimes the best resources are your teachers. Don't be afraid to reach
