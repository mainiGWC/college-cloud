            Requirements:
          </h3>
          <br />
          <p class="scheduleText">
            In twelfth grade, you should be taking Government (honors or AP), English 12
            (honors or AP), Pre-Calculus or Calculus (based on the last math
            you took in eleventh grade), a science of your choice (honors or AP), a Language Other
            Than English IV or (based on what you took before) or an elective/AP class of your choice, and Economics (h)
            <br />
            <br />
            You are only required to take 3 years of math, or as many years of
            math that gets you to Algebra II. We highly recommend taking 4 years
            of math or all the way to Calculus. Not only does it increase your
            competitiveness for college, but it allows you to gain more of an
            understanding of more kinds of math, which can help you later in
            college.
            <br />
            <br />
            In terms of the A-G requirements, only 2 years of a Language Other
            Than English is required. If your school offers more levels of the
            language you have chosen to take, we at WEBSITE NAME recommend
            taking a 3rd or 4th year of the class. Taking more years of a
            Language Other Than English increases your competitiveness for
            college as well as allows you to become fluent in another language.
