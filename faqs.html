          Should I take community college classes outside of my high school?

          <p class="insideText">
            You don't have to take any community college classes outside of your
            high school, but we highly recommend you doing so! Taking community
            college classes can boost your GPA as well as help you take classes
            which you find interesting that aren't offered at your high school.
            There are no downsides to taking community college classes outside
            of your high school!

            Any that you're interested in! It's important to show colleges that
            you're well-rounded and have multiple interests. Activities are also
            a good way to figure out what kinds of careers you're interested in.
            Being involved in academic clubs can also help colleges see that
            you're invested in learning which can never hurt!

          <p class="insideText">
            For community college, it is still important to do your best in
            school and take all of the classes that interest you, but you don't
            need to take as rigorous AP's or stack up multiple additional
            community college courses. In preparation for a 4-year university,
            it is best to take as many AP's and additional community college
            courses as you can, without overworking yourself. 4-year
            universities are generally more rigorous than community colleges, so
            keep that in mind when choosing which classes to add to your
            schedule.

          Should I get involved in a sport or is it okay if I don't?
        </button>
        <div class="board">
          <p class="insideText">
            Getting involved in a sport shows that you have collaboration skills
            and are a well-rounded individual. It is not necessary for you to
            get involved in a sport if you are disinterested or if you don't
            have the time. Many college preparation guides recommend being
            involved in a sport, but if you have equivalent experience from a
            different activity (being part of a group for a volunteering
            experience, being in a club with a specific purpose which includes
            working together, etc.) then you don't need to worry!

            Make sure to stay organized, don't overwork yourself, and have fun!
            It's important to stay organized in high school with either a
            planner or an equivalent method. Time management is a primary aspect
            of high school life, you need to make sure you have enough time to
            finish and do all of your assigments before the due dates. If you're
            taking AP courses or additional community college classes,
            organization is a MUST. It's also important to remember that you're
            a human who needs to rest. Don't overload yourself with so many
            activities and classes that you no longer have time to do other
            things! High school is also an amazing time to hang out with your
            friends and do different things with them. Make sure that you don't
            have all work and no play! Enjoy your high school experience, and
            don't stress, as long as you try your best, you'll be fine!

          When should I start my college application?
        </button>
        <div class="board">
          <p class="insideText">
            Start writing down all of your extracurricular hours and the
            different community college classes you have taken (if you've taken
            any) as you do them, this is going to make the college application
            process much easier if you have all of them written down with the
            dates. With the essay writing (if the college your applying to asks
            for it) you can start as early as the spring of junior year!
            Definitely make sure to ask for teacher recommendations right when
            you start your senior year. Time management and planning is very
            important in this process so keep everything written down and
            organized!

            Most schools have students take the PSAT in the fall of their
            freshman, sophomore, and junior years of high school. They also
            normally have students do ACT/SAT with the writing parts in the
            spring of sophomore and junior year, as well as the fall of senior
            year. In short, your school should facilitate and tell you when to
            take both tests.

          <p class="insideText">
            It's important to build a relationship with all of your teachers.
            Show up to their classes on time, be polite when asking questions,
            ask questions so they know who you are, and participate in class so
            they can get familiar with you! When thinking about which teacher to
            ask for your letter of recommendation, consider the area of study
            you're most interested in. If you want to go into the STEM field,
            your math and/or science teacher may be the best choice. Ask your
            teacher for a letter of recommendation when you're applying for
            colleges in the fall of your senior year!

          How important are language classes? Should I take more than the
          required amount?
        </button>
        <div class="board">
          <p class="insideText">
            Language classes are not super important. Taking more than the
            required amount can help you become fluent in the language that
            you're taking (if that's something you're interested in doing) and
            it can help you look more competitive to colleges. If you don't feel
            interested in taking more language classes than required, spend your
            energy elsewhere! Colleges will still love to see that you have an
            interest in other subjects even if languages aren't your thing!

          Is freshman year really that important?
        </button>
        <div class="board">
          <p class="insideText">
            In short, no it is not. But, that doesn't mean you shouldn't try
            your best in your freshman year of high school. If you get a C in
            one class freshman year, it's not the end of the world, or if you
            get B's in multiple classes. The important thing to remember though
            with that being said, is that all of your final grades freshman year
            will apply to your overall GPA when you graduate from high school.
            So don't sweat it if you got a few B's, but make sure you try your
            best every year!
