          Should I take community college classes outside of my high school?

          <p>
            You don't have to take any community college classes outside of your
            high school, but we highly recommend you doing so! Taking community
            college classes can boost your GPA as well as help you take classes
            which you find interesting that aren't offered at your high school.
            There are no downsides to taking community college classes outside
            of your high school!

          <p>
            Any that you're interested in! It's important to show colleges that
            you're well-rounded and have multiple interests. Activities are also
            a good way to figure out what kinds of careers you're interested in.
            Being involved in academic clubs can also help colleges see that
            you're invested in learning which can never hurt!
