          Should I take community college classes outside of my high school?

        <div class="board">
          <p>
            You don't have to take any community college classes outside of your
            high school, but we highly recommend you doing so! Taking community
            college classes can boost your GPA as well as help you take classes
            which you find interesting that aren't offered at your high school.
            There are no downsides to taking community college classes outside
            of your high school!

            Any that you're interested in! It's important to show colleges that
            you're well-rounded and have multiple interests. Activities are also
            a good way to figure out what kinds of careers you're interested in.
            Being involved in academic clubs can also help colleges see that
            you're invested in learning which can never hurt!

          What are the average GPA's of students in high school going to a
          4-year university versus a community college?
        </button>
        <div class="board">
          <p>
            For 4-year universities, the average GPA is 3.75. For community
            college, 2.0 GPA's and above are accepted.

        <div class="board">
          <p>
            For community college, it is still important to do your best in
            school and take all of the classes that interest you, but you don't
            need to take as rigorous AP's or stack up multiple additional
            community college courses. In preparation for a 4-year university,
            it is best to take as many AP's and additional community college
            courses as you can, without overworking yourself. 4-year
            universities are generally more rigorous than community colleges, so
            keep that in mind when choosing which classes to add to your
            schedule.

          Should I get involved in a sport or is it ok if I don't?
        </button>
        <div class="board">
          <p>
            Getting involved in a sport shows that you have collaboration skills
            and are a well-rounded individual. It is not necessary for you to
            get involved in a sport if you are disinterested or if you don't
            have the time. Many college preparation guides recommend being
            involved in a sport, but if you have equivalent experience from a
            different activity (being part of a group for a volunteering
            experience, being in a club with a specific purpose which includes
            working together, etc.) then you don't need to worry!

          <p>
            Make sure to stay organized, don't overwork yourself, and have fun!
            It's important to stay organized in high school with either a
            planner or an equivalent method. Time management is a primary aspect
            of high school life, you need to make sure you have enough time to
            finish and do all of your assigments before the due dates. If you're
            taking AP courses or additional community college classes,
            organization is a MUST. It's also important to remember that you're
            a human who needs to rest. Don't overload yourself with so many
            activities and classes that you no longer have time to do other
            things! High school is also an amazing time to hang out with your
            friends and do different things with them. Make sure that you don't
            have all work and no play! Enjoy your high school experience, and
            don't stress, as long as you try your best, you'll be fine!
