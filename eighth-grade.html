        <p>
          Not necessarily. Of course, you need to take all of the required years
          of classes. If you're interested in the medical field, for example,
          taking AP Biology may be a good thing to consider. But if your high
          school doesn't have classes which reflect the career you're
          considering, don't worry! Community college classes are always an
          effective way to show your interest in specific subjects. It's also
          important for colleges to see that you're well rounded! You want to
          show that you have interests in various subjects and activities.

      <button class="folding">
        Can I take more years of a class even if the required is less?
      </button>
      <div class="board">
        <p>
          Yes! If you want to look more competitive to colleges, taking more
          years of a class is a great way to do that. It shows that you can
          stick with something and it shows that you're interested in that
          subject.
