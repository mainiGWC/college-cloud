        <p>
          Although they may sound complex and intimidating, extracurriculars encompass 
          almost anything that’s isn’t required for credit and that isn’t simply for your 
          own benefit, like playing video games. And the good news is, you probably do a 
          few already! They really can be anything: clubs, sports, community service, employment, 
          academic teams — the list goes on and on. As long as the activity involves your 
          contribution to others, it’s pretty safe to call it an extracurricular.

        <h4 class = "center" style = "font-size: 20pt"> Why are they so important?</h4>
        <p>
          Extracurriculars are a <span class = "bold">vital</span> component of college 
          applications; along with test scores, grades, and essays, they’re just one more 
          way to show colleges your unique abilities and interests. Whether or not you 
          have the luxury of pursuing sports or interest clubs, colleges really want to 
          know how you spend your time outside of school. Outside involvement 
          (especially long-term) implies dedication and showcases your hunger to make 
          an impact on the world around you. Extracurriculars are an amazing asset to 
          your own life, as well; activities like volunteering teach gratefulness and 
          humility, and academic teams can further your knowledge of potential interests 
          and set you ahead in those subjects. Not to mention, they’re the perfect way to 
          meet new friends and make connections that may come in handy down the line. 
          Overall, extracurricular activities can be some of your best friends in high school, 
          and we highly recommend you partake in plenty.

          How to get started:
        </h4>
        <p class = "center" style = "font-size: 16pt">
          Now, you’re probably wondering exactly how you can get involved in your community. 
          Well, there are three main steps you should consider taking to decide how to proceed. 
          <ol style = "font-size: 14pt">
            <li>Taking some time to research what organizations are available around you should be 
            your first thought. Many cities have parks or libraries with bulletin boards of activities, 
            and almost all middle and high schools will have clubs, academic teams, and sports 
            teams enumerated on their website. When researching, try to consider some communities you 
            already belong to. Do you go to church? Are you interested in math? Maybe debate is more 
            your thing? How about running? Thinking about what you already do or are interested in will 
            be extremely helpful in narrowing down your searches. And remember: these do not have to be 
            in-person activities! There are plenty of remote volunteer opportunities such as blanket-making 
            or card-crafting that can be done right from the comfort of your own home. 
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>Now that you’ve researched, try to make a list of at least three possible activities, 
              but ideally as many as you can. There’s a good chance some of them won’t take, and at 
              least you’ll have all your other options to back you up! 
              <span style = "font-style: italic">Note: College applications have anywhere from 10-20 slots for activities, so try to always be participating 
              in a few so that you’ll accumulate many throughout high school!</span>
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>Your third move is to test out all the activities on your list. This is an absolutely 
              essential step since there’s a good chance some of your activities won’t be your cup of 
              tea, or that they don’t fit your schedule. Plus, this gives you a chance to gauge whether 
              the community, team, or organization will be beneficial to you in the long term. 
              <span style = "font-style: italic"> Note: reflect on each activity after you’ve attended 
                at least one (preferably two) meetings. ask yourself this: can i see myself continuing 
                here long- term? Will this contribute to my life in a positive way, without taking away 
                from my studies or personal life? If the answer is yes, I think you’ve got your extracurricular!
              </span>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class = "center" style = "font-size: 16pt">
        By following this simple procedure, you’re sure to find some amazing communities and make a lasting connection.
